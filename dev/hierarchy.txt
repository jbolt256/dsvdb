Databases and rooms store NO data besides metadata. Rooms only exist for the categorization of data.
Only tables store data.

When creating a handler, the handler is valid only for the database selected. To use a different database,
a different handler will need to be created, or the current handler must be
modified. Credentials are verified on every request.

All requests have the following POST information:
	database: [string name]
	operatorID: [string opID]
	operatorPW: [string opPWD]
	action:	[string op]
	query:	[json data]

Upon receiving a request, the request handler will create a new database instance, but only after verifying the identity of
the operator. Should the identification fail, the request is immediately terminated. The database handler then
interprets and gathers data on itself and existing rooms & tables.

Should the authentication succeed, the request is then sent to an internal request server, where it processes the request. 
A "GET" request returns json data or internal error. A "POST" request only returns an OK/internal error. 

A connection handler handles the overall connection. A request handler handles each individual request. In order to 
improve performance, dsvdb allows for a maximum of 32 simultaneous requests, which are handled synchronously by
dsvdb.
