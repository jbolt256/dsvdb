When a new connection is made, the following conditions MUST be met (every single one), or else the program should
immediately terminate without any further execution.
* OperatorID, OperatorPW, database, and the n parameters MUST be provided. However, for the n parameter, if it is not
set, it will default to one (1).
* n must be equal to the actual number of provided requests.
* The operator's identification must be verified (authenticated).
* All the r*_action and r*_query parameters must be provided for each action query.

The following conditions should be met, and will throw an error if not met, but will not result in the program terminating:
* all actions exist
* all parameters required by action are provided in query

In the event that one or both of these conditions are not met, the response for that action query will be "ERR".
